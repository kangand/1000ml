# Jewellery Classification Problem

**Scenario:** 

The company wishes to implement a feature where customers can upload images of their jewellery online, and the system will read the image to recommend similar products.

**Objective:**

Develop an image classification model for the four jewellery groups:
* Bracelets
* Rings
* Necklaces
* Earrings

**Contents:**
* CNN_Overview
  * Testing of all models on small batch size and epoch number
* CNN_Training
  * Fitting the final model on larger batch size with more epochs
* CNN_Testing
  * Loading trained model to test on fresh test dataset

* Draft_Model 
  * Rough initial model testing
  * Includes tensorflow.keras models not used in final presentation
